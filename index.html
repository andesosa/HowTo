    <p> Among many Venezuelan families it is accustomed for the whole family to reunite during a weekday to have lunch. Most of the times the main entree for this lunch is the <i>asado negro</i>. the <i>asado negro</i> is one of Venezuela’s most famous and delicious customary foods. If you directly translate <i>asado negro</i> to english it would be <b>black roast</b>. It is called this way because of the black color of the sauce and the meat.It is common for each family to have their own unique and special <i>asado negro</i> recipe, so today I’m gonna share my own family’s recipe. </p>

  <!-- used a p tag for the first paragraph of the recipe-->
  <p>First of all you should buy a eye of round cut and put it into a frying pan. The second step is to add some olive oil and garlic. Let it rest until the oil gains a gold and black color (this will help give the eye of round cut some flavor). Afterwards you’ll need to pour some water into the pan so that it covers the meat. Let it rest for a while and meanwhile you’ll need to get some cayennes, tomatoes, onion, and sweet chili peppers. Cut all these ingredients and put them into a blender (also add a little bit of water).</p>
  <!-- used a p tag for the second paragraph of the recipe. Also us a b tag to show importance and i tags to show a different language-->
  <p>After blending the ingredients, add them to the pan (also add some salt and pepper to the mix). Let it fry for, <b>maximum</b>, an hour. Afterwards take the meat out of the pan and cut it into pieces. Put the meat strips back in the frying pan and add half a can of the beverage <i>malta</i>. Wait until the meat is tender and then it is ready to eat. Yet you are not finished, the <i>asado negro</i> is a food that needs to be eaten with various side dishes. </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <!-- used a p tag for the conclusion and used an i tag for language differences. Also used a q tag to quote my grandmother-->
    <p>In conclusion the <i>asado negro</i> is a typical venezuelan meal that is meant to be eaten with love ones. As my grandmother says <q><i>porque el amor no es poseer, sino compartir</i></q>. This means that love is not about possession, but about sharing. So what are you waiting for? Go on and share this recipe with your family members and friends.</p>
