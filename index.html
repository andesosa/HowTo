  <!-- used a p tag for the first paragraph of the recipe-->
  <p>First of all you should buy a eye of round cut and put it into a frying pan. The second step is to add some olive oil and garlic. Let it rest until the oil gains a gold and black color (this will help give the eye of round cut some flavor). Afterwards you’ll need to pour some water into the pan so that it covers the meat. Let it rest for a while and meanwhile you’ll need to get some cayennes, tomatoes, onion, and sweet chili peppers. Cut all these ingredients and put them into a blender (also add a little bit of water).</p>
  <!-- used a p tag for the second paragraph of the recipe. Also us a b tag to show importance and i tags to show a different language-->
  <p>After blending the ingredients, add them to the pan (also add some salt and pepper to the mix). Let it fry for, <b>maximum</b>, an hour. Afterwards take the meat out of the pan and cut it into pieces. Put the meat strips back in the frying pan and add half a can of the beverage <i>malta</i>. Wait until the meat is tender and then it is ready to eat. Yet you are not finished, the <i>asado negro</i> is a food that needs to be eaten with various side dishes. </p>
